    <p>A good kitty and Isaac's one true companion. For this, may he be granted the peace he is owed.</p>
    <h2>Why Guppy is great:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Is a cat</li>
        <li>Collect three of his parts to transform into Guppy!</li>
        <li>Furry friend</li>
        <li>Even in death, he is helpful and remains faithful</li>
    </ol>
